# Reading List

A list of books that I have read, am reading, or would like to read, in no particular order. Eventually, my hope is for this to become a book review list as well.

Standard disclaimer that the presence of a book on this list is not necessarily an endorsement of any ideas contained within said book. Non-standard disclaimer that the presence of a book on this list probably signals that it's pretty interesting.
