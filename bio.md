# About me

## Work

My interests lie primarily at the intersection of markets and technology.
I enjoy learning about and designing the financial infrastructure that helps people discover, trade with, and pay one another.
I want to make better products that increase marketplace efficiency and equip people to make better choices by providing fair playing fields, transparent rules, and competitive options.

I'm currently working as a product manager on multi-sided investment marketplaces at iCapital, with a focus on making alternative investments more accessible to everyday investors.
I've previously worked on payments and liquidity infrastructure at J.P. Morgan.

## Non-Work

When I'm not working, you can usually find me doing something related to one (or more) of the following:
* [Reading](reading.md)
* Writing
* [Poetry](poetry.md)
* Looking for cheap eats
* Board games, especially Eurogames
* Pondering
* Ice skating or rollerblading (depending on the season)
* Puzzles (mostly crosswords, sometimes jigsaws, occasionally math/logic)

## Other

I've been living in New York City since 2021.
I grew up in a suburb of Minneapolis, Minnesota.
I have a soft spot for Manchester, England, where I spent a semester being a student, but British.

I studied accounting at the University of Minnesota.
I like accounting because I am interested in numbers, rules, and the design of frameworks and mechanisms to capture truthy, quantifiable, and useful representations of complex economic situations while being implemented by entities with a wide range of interests and incentives. Unsurprisingly, I also have interests in law and economics.
